## Portfolio Optimization: Classical Methods vs. Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains an example-based walkthrough of mean-variance optimization using the [PyPortfolioOpt](https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt) library. The focus is on demonstrating effective methods for portfolio optimization, from basic covariance calculations to complex constrained optimizations.

## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive walkthrough of portfolio optimization techniques, comparing classical methods with deep reinforcement learning approaches. The primary focus is on mean-variance optimization using the PyPortfolioOpt library, demonstrating effective strategies from fundamental covariance calculations to advanced constrained optimizations.

Mean-variance optimization is a cornerstone of modern portfolio theory, enabling investors to balance risk and return. This project demonstrates:
- Covariance matrix visualization.
- Portfolio optimization (e.g., minimum variance, maximum Sharpe ratio).
- Integration of sector constraints.
- Efficient frontier plotting (simple, constrained, and complex).

## Features

This project covers:

1. Covariance Matrix Visualization: Understanding asset relationships through heatmaps and matrix plots.

2. Portfolio Optimization: Minimum variance portfolio construction, Maximum Sharpe ratio optimization, Efficient capital allocation.

3. Sector Constraints Integration: Implementing real-world constraints for balanced diversification.

4. Efficient Frontier Plotting: Unconstrained optimization, Sector-constrained and complex portfolio visualizations.

## Next Steps

This repository serves as a foundation for more advanced portfolio optimization techniques, including deep reinforcement learning for dynamic asset allocation. Stay tuned for updates integrating AI-driven strategies!
