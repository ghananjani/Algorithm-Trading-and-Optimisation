Portfolio Optimization: Classical Methods vs. Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains an example-based walkthrough of mean-variance optimization using the [PyPortfolioOpt](https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt) library. The focus is on demonstrating effective methods for portfolio optimization, from basic covariance calculations to complex constrained optimizations.

## Overview
Mean-variance optimization is a cornerstone of modern portfolio theory, enabling investors to balance risk and return. This project demonstrates:
- Covariance matrix visualization.
- Portfolio optimization (e.g., minimum variance, maximum Sharpe ratio).
- Integration of sector constraints.
- Efficient frontier plotting (simple, constrained, and complex).
